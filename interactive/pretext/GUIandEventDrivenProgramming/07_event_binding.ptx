  <title>Low-Level Event Processing</title>
  <p>In the previous lessons you learned how to associate simple user actions with
            the most common user events, such as clicking on a button. For
            simple GUI programs this is typically sufficient. But for more complex programs
            you might need to process <q>lower level</q> events, such as recognizing when
            the user's cursor is over a widget, or when a widget becomes the focus
            of user input. To handle these types of events you need to implement
            <term>event binding</term>. This lesson provides an overview of how to process any
            event that happens on a computer. We will not use these techniques in
            most of the simple GUI programs we discuss, but you should be aware of
            what is possible.</p>
