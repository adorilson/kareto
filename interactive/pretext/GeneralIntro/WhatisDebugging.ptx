  <title>What is Debugging?</title>
  <p>Programming is a complex process.  Since it is done by human beings, errors may often occur.
            Programming errors are called <term>bugs</term> and the process
            of tracking them down and correcting them is called <term>debugging</term>.  Some claim
            that in 1945, a dead moth caused a problem on relay number 70, panel F, of one
            of the first computers at Harvard, and the term <term>bug</term> has remained in use
            since. For more about this historic event, see <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:H96566k.jpg" visual="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:H96566k.jpg">first bug</url>.</p>
  <p>Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_error" visual="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_error">syntax errors</url>, <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_error" visual="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_error">runtime errors</url>, and <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_error" visual="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_error">semantic errors</url>.  It is useful to distinguish
            between them in order to track them down more quickly.</p>

        <statement>
          <p>tracking down programming errors and correcting them.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
                    Programming errors are called bugs and the process of finding and removing them from a program is called debugging.

          <p>removing all the bugs from your house.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
                    Maybe, but that is not what we are talking about in this context.

        <statement>
          <p>finding all the bugs in the program.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
                    This is partially correct.  But, debugging is more than just finding the bugs.  What do you need to do once you find them?

        <statement>
          <p>fixing the bugs in the program.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
                    This is partially correct.  But, debugging is more than just fixing the bugs. What do you need to do before you can fix them?
