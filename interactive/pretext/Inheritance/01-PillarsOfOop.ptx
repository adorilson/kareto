  <title>Pillars of OOP</title>
  <p>Object-oriented programming involves four key ideas: encapsulation, information
            hiding, inheritance, and polymorphism. <term>Encapsulation</term> is the idea that
            a class can package some data together with the methods that manipulate the
            data. This is a powerful capability, and the chief idea that distinguishes OOP
            from structured programming. <term>Information Hiding</term> promotes quality
            code by allowing objects to protect their state against direct manipulation by
            code using the object. Python, like many languages, provides mechanisms
            to achieve information hiding, but we do not cover them in this book.
            <term>Inheritance</term> and <term>polymorphism</term> are mechanisms that help to enable
            code reuse and contract-based programming, and are the subject of this chapter.</p>
