  <title>Functions that Produce Lists</title>
  <p>The pure version of <c>doubleStuff</c> above made use of an
            important <term>pattern</term> for your toolbox. Whenever you need to
            write a function that creates and returns a list, the pattern is
            usually:</p>
  <pre>initialize a result variable to be an empty list
loop
   create a new element
   append it to result
return the result</pre>
  <p>Let us show another use of this pattern.  Assume you already have a function
            <c>is_prime(x)</c> that can test if x is prime.  Now, write a function
            to return a list of all prime numbers less than n:</p>
  <pre>def primes_upto(n):
    """ Return a list of all prime numbers less than n. """
    result = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(i):
            result.append(i)
    return result</pre>
