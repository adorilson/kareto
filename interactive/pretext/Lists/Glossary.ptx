      <title>aliases</title>
      <p>Multiple variables that contain references to the same object.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>clone</title>
      <p>To create a new object that has the same value as an existing object.
                            Copying a reference to an object creates an alias but doesn't clone the
                            object.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>delimiter</title>
      <p>A character or string used to indicate where a string should be split.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>element</title>
      <p>One of the values in a list (or other sequence). The bracket operator
                            selects elements of a list.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>index</title>
      <p>An integer variable or value that indicates an element of a list.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>list</title>
      <p>A collection of objects, where each object is identified by an index.
                            Like other types <c>str</c>, <c>int</c>, <c>float</c>, etc. there is also a
                            <c>list</c> type-converter function that tries to turn its argument into a
                            list.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>list traversal</title>
      <p>The sequential accessing of each element in a list.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>modifier</title>
      <p>A function which changes its arguments inside the function body. Only
                            mutable types can be changed by modifiers.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>mutable data type</title>
      <p>A data type in which the elements can be modified. All mutable types
                            are compound types. Lists are mutable data types; strings are not.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>nested list</title>
      <p>A list that is an element of another list.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>object</title>
      <p>A thing to which a variable can refer.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>pattern</title>
      <p>A sequence of statements, or a style of coding something that has
                            general applicability in a number of different situations.  Part of
                            becoming a mature Computer Scientist is to learn and establish the
                            patterns and algorithms that form your toolkit.  Patterns often
                            correspond to your <q>mental chunking</q>.</p>

      <title>pure function</title>
      <p>A function which has no side effects. Pure functions only make changes
                            to the calling program through their return values.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>sequence</title>
      <p>Any of the data types that consist of an ordered collection of elements, with
                            each element identified by an index.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>side effect</title>
      <p>A change in the state of a program made by calling a function that is
                            not a result of reading the return value from the function. Side
                            effects can only be produced by modifiers.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>tuple</title>
      <p>A sequential collection of items, similar to a list.  Any python object can be an element of a tuple.  However, unlike a list, tuples are immutable.</p>
