  <title>Lists</title>
  <p>A <term>list</term> is a sequential collection of Python data values, where each value is identified by an
            index. The values that make up a list are called its <term>elements</term>. Lists are
            similar to strings, which are ordered collections of characters, except that the
            elements of a list can have any type and for any one list, the items can be of different types.</p>
