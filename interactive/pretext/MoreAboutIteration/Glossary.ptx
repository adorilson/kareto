      <title>algorithm</title>
      <p>A step-by-step process for solving a category of problems.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>body</title>
      <p>The indented statements after a heading ending in a colon,
                            for instance after a for-loop heading.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>counter</title>
      <p>A variable used to count something, usually initialized to zero and
                            incremented in the body of a loop.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>cursor</title>
      <p>An invisible marker that keeps track of where the next character will
                            be printed.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>definite iteration</title>
      <p>A loop where we have an upper bound on the number of times the
                            body will be executed.  Definite iteration is usually best coded
                            as a <c>for</c> loop.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>escape sequence</title>
      <p>An escape character, \, followed by one or more printable characters
                            used to designate a nonprintable character.</p>
    </gi>

      <title>generalize</title>
      <p>To replace something unnecessarily specific (like a constant value)
                            with something appropriately general (like a variable or parameter).
                            Generalization makes code more versatile, more likely to be reused, and
                            sometimes even easier to write.</p>

    <gi>
      <title>infinite loop</title>
      <p>A loop in which the terminating condition is never satisfied.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>indefinite iteration</title>
      <p>A loop where we just need to keep going until some condition is met.
                            A <c>while</c> statement is used for this case.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>iteration</title>
      <p>Repeated execution of a set of programming statements.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>loop</title>
      <p>A statement or group of statements that execute repeatedly until a
                            terminating condition is satisfied.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>loop variable</title>
      <p>A variable used as part of the terminating condition of a loop.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>nested loop</title>
      <p>A loop inside the body of another loop.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>newline</title>
      <p>A special character that causes the cursor to move to the beginning of
                            the next line.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>reassignment</title>
      <p>Making more than one assignment to the same variable during the
                            execution of a program.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>tab</title>
      <p>A special character that causes the cursor to move to the next tab stop
                            on the current line.</p>
