  <title>Index Operator: Working with the Characters of a String</title>
  <p>The <term>indexing operator</term> (Python uses square brackets to enclose the index)
            selects a single character from a string.  The characters are accessed by their position or
            index value.  For example, in the string shown below, the 14 characters are indexed left to right from postion 0 to position 13.</p>
  <image source="Strings/Figures/indexvalues.png" width="50%" alt="index values"/>
  <p>It is also the case that the positions are named from right to left using negative numbers where -1 is the rightmost
            index and so on.
            Note that the character at index 6 (or -8) is the blank character.</p>
  <program xml:id="chp08_index1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
school = "Luther College"
m = school[2]
print(m)

lastchar = school[-1]
print(lastchar)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>The expression <c>school[2]</c> selects the character at index 2 from <c>school</c>, and creates a new
            string containing just this one character. The variable <c>m</c> refers to the result.</p>
  <p>Remember that computer scientists often start counting
            from zero. The letter at index zero of <c>"Luther College"</c> is <c>L</c>.  So at
            position <c>[2]</c> we have the letter <c>t</c>.</p>
  <p>If you want the zero-eth letter of a string, you just put 0, or any expression
            with the value 0, in the brackets.  Give it a try.</p>
  <p>The expression in brackets is called an <term>index</term>. An index specifies a member
            of an ordered collection.  In this case the collection of characters in the string. The index
            <em>indicates</em> which character you want. It can be any integer
            expression so long as it evaluates to a valid index value.</p>
  <p>Note that indexing returns a <em>string</em> &#x2014; Python has no special type for a single character.
            It is just a string of length 1.</p>
