  <title>Strings Revisited</title>
  <p>Throughout the first chapters of this book we have used strings to represent words or phrases that we
            wanted to print out.  Our definition was simple:  a string is simply some characters inside quotes.  In this chapter we explore strings in much more detail.</p>
